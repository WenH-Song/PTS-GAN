# Progressive Text-Semantic-Aware Generative Adversarial Network for Image Fusion (PTS-GAN)

This is the official implementation of paper Progressive Text-Semantic-Aware Generative Adversarial Network for Image Fusion". 

### Abstract
*Infrared and visible image fusion~(IVF) aims to synthesize comprehensive representations that preserve thermal signatures and visible textures. Existing IVF methods predominantly focus on pixel-level feature combinations but struggle to maintain semantic coherence in complex scenarios.
To address this challenge, we propose a Progressive Text-Semantic-Aware Generative Adversarial Network (PTS-GAN) for infrared and visible image fusion.
Specifically, we present a semantic-aware generator to preserve multi-scale local-global features of cross-modal semantics. It integrates the Dual Attention Routing~(DAR) module with the Transformer architecture.Meanwhile, we propose a Textual Semantic Alignment~(TSA) module to align CLIP text embeddings with multi-scale visual features. Moreover, a dual progressive discriminator is built to maintain semantic consistency between fused and source images through hierarchical adversarial training. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods objectively and subjectively.*
